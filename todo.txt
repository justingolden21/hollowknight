important:

maybe:
- display kingsong/grimm charm set as tabs
- recommended charm setups for bosses? https://youtu.be/pPbsCEaplZE

filters:
- filter by notch cost, method of obtaining (purchase from x, purchase from y, found in z, rescure x grubs), location, or cost (more than/less than x)
- option to add filters to url param?
- locations spoiler click to show, toggle switch at top to show/hide locations and abilities

modals:
- what are charms, how to equip them/benches, how many notches, where to get more notches, info on overcharming
- view charms on modal, view as one large table in modal, print friendly table
- charm achievements

misc:
- where should print btn be placed? need @print css media rule
- display unbreakable charms in table?
- tabs in info modal for settings (such as spoiler settings, fullscreen toggle)
- add donate btn to info? nah
- change email link to btn?
- use realfavicongenerator.net
- SEO
- make it a PWA
- url param for opening the charm modal
- interacts well with section for charms? see "charm interactions" on the wiki
- make clickable tags? sort by that category?
- for printable charms, option to drag them around and choose which ones to print, select image size, etc in settings modal
- add combos (display combo charms, clickable links to that charm modal, details/summary for each charm interaction, opening one closes the others, show charm notches for combo charms, list of all combos modal, toggle for displaying combos in printable table)
- charm tier list maker? with link to list in url param and downloadable img
- charm + notch set builder (choose which charms to equip, see notches used, view all effects of equipped charms, option to save multiple layouts)
- add image of longnail / mark of pride striking distance to both charm modals

notes:
- handle grimmchild charm differently in print table (details tag in description...)
- some charms (ie kingsoul) have multiple locations
- void heart costs 0 notches to equip
- implement sorting by category by adding category as data- element to charms, then filtering by those
- add interactions with other charms by having a string such as "{Charm:Wayward_Compass}" that is meant to be replaced with the image and link for that charm
- to implement more filters, need one big function that handles all filters (all checkboxes) and scans through to see if each charm meets the filters or not and shows/hides it
- should categories and charms be "or" or "and"? probably "and". can have dropdown or toggle for or/and between the checkbox rows, but doesn't seem worthwhile
- charm combos: https://youtu.be/XMzS2Fra-WE (and on wiki)

bugs:
- effects are spoiled?
