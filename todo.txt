maybe:
- display kingsong/grimm charm set as tabs

filters:
- filter by category (movement, geo, soul, attack, defense), notch cost, method of obtaining (purchase from x, purchase from y, found in z, rescure x grubs), location, or cost (more than/less than x)
- option to add filters to url param?
- option to filter by category with "or" or "and" for either category or must contain all categories
- locations spoiler click to show, toggle switch at top to show/hide locations and abilities

modals:
- what are charms, how to equip them/benches, how many notches, where to get more notches, overcharmed
- view charms on modal, view as one large table in modal, print friendly table
- charm achievements

misc:
- add google analytics?
- url param for opening the charm modal
- interacts well with section for charms? see "charm interactions" on the wiki
- make clickable tags? sort by that category?

notes:
- some charms (ie kingsoul) have multiple locations
- void heart costs 0 notches to equip
- implement sorting by category by adding category as data- element to charms, then filtering by those
- add interactions with other charms by having a string such as "{Charm:Wayward_Compass}" that is meant to be replaced with the image and link for that charm

bugs:
- effects are spoiled?
