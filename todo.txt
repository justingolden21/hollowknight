maybe:
- display kingsong/grimm charm set as tabs

filters:
- filter by notch cost, method of obtaining (purchase from x, purchase from y, found in z, rescure x grubs), location, or cost (more than/less than x)
- option to add filters to url param?
- locations spoiler click to show, toggle switch at top to show/hide locations and abilities

modals:
- what are charms, how to equip them/benches, how many notches, where to get more notches, overcharmed
- view charms on modal, view as one large table in modal, print friendly table
- charm achievements

misc:
- full desc vs short desc setting for charm table? toggle adjacent to title or in footer?
- where should print btn be placed? need @print css media rule
- display unbreakable charms in table?
- tabs in info modal for settings (such as spoiler settings, fullscreen toggle)
- add donate btn to info? nah
- change email link to btn?
- use realfavicongenerator.net
- SEO
- make it a PWA
- url param for opening the charm modal
- interacts well with section for charms? see "charm interactions" on the wiki
- make clickable tags? sort by that category?

notes:
- handle grimmchild charm differently in print table (details tag in description...)
- some charms (ie kingsoul) have multiple locations
- void heart costs 0 notches to equip
- implement sorting by category by adding category as data- element to charms, then filtering by those
- add interactions with other charms by having a string such as "{Charm:Wayward_Compass}" that is meant to be replaced with the image and link for that charm
- to implement more filters, need one big function that handles all filters (all checkboxes) and scans through to see if each charm meets the filters or not and shows/hides it
- should categories and charms be "or" or "and"? probably "and". can have dropdown or toggle for or/and between the checkbox rows, but doesn't seem worthwhile

bugs:
- effects are spoiled?
